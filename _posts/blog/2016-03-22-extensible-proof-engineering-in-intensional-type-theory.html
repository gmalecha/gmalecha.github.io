  PhD Defense: Extensible Proof Engineering in Intensional Type Theory
---

<p>You can now watch my thesis defense on computational reflection in intensional type theory.
Some minor hicups during the talk but otherwise gives a very high-level overview of <a href="https://github.com/gmalecha/mirror-core">MirrorCore</a> and Rtac at the time (2014).
