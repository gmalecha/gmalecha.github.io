abstract: |
  We consider software verification of imperative programs by theorem proving in higher-order separation logic. Separation logic is quite effective for reasoning about tree-like data structures, but less so for data structures with more complex sharing patterns. This problem is compounded by some higher-order patterns, such as stateful iterators and visitors, where multiple clients need to share references into a data structure. We show how both styles of sharing can be achieved without sacrificing abstraction using mechanized reasoning about fractional permissions in Hoare Type Theory.
